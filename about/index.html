                <p class="package__info">
                    Aaron McGarvey is a practical problem solver who has worked on many of the most challenging issues facing the water industry today. A Data Scientist, he has worked with data
                    from virtually every domain across the modern water utility. Though he is an expert in multiple technical domains including data science and software engineering, 
                    Aaron's real skills lie in his ability to uncover the underlying operational issues facing water utility operations and connect them to simple solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Aaron's journey in the water industry began at American Water, the largest water utility in the US. As a 
                    Data Scientist on a team of industry veterans with decades of experience providing water and wastewater services to 15 million people, 
                    he experienced a side of technology development rarely seen by Data Scientists, Developers,
                    and even Product Managers. Part of an $80 million dollar campaign to create "a digital platform for everything water," he saw many apps fail and a few succeed. <br><br>
                    
                    It was out of this experience that Aaron's vision for simple, practical technology for the water industry was born. Utilizing his technical expertise, 
                    he is able to provide end-to-end digital solutions while maintaining a relatively light footprint. <br><br>


                    <!-- Successful adoption was achieved only when the stakeholders were put at the center of 
                    product development process.  -->

                    <!-- He witnessed first-hand the challenges of building and deploying digital solutions for the water industry. 
                    Of as many as 30 apps that were part of an $80 million dollar campaign to create "a digital platform for everything water," he knows of only one that ever got adopted. -->

                    <!-- It was only in being forced to work on the "Ops side" 
                    of the fence that Aaron began to fully comprehend just how badly water utilities needed help with their data.
                    
                    
                    
                    learned 
                    one of the most important lessons of his career -- that the key to digital transformation in the water industry is more about building long-term relationships that are centered on trust. <br><br> -->


                    Most importantly, Aaron is passionate about solving water's biggest problems, particularly as climate change and environmental degradation continue to threaten both water quantity and quality around the world. Aaron's
                    long-term goal is to one day give back by helping disadvantaged communities around the world gain access to clean water.<br><br>

                    Aaron currently serves as Director of Data and Analytics at StormSensor, Inc -- a climate technology company focused on analytics for stormwater systems. He is a member of AWWA and has been featured 
                    as part of the SWAN forum's "Rising Smart Water Professionals" program.
                    He has a Masters Degree in Applied Geoscience from the University of Pennsylvania,
                    and lives with his wife, Magy,
                    and two children, Sebastian and Ana, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.</p>



                    
                    <!-- Hired as a Scientist in the Technology and Innovation group. Billed as a "startup within
                    a water utility", the goal of the T&I group was to build "a digital platform for everything water." Unfortunately, however, the end-users were not involved in the product development process
                    and the whole initiative failed at rollout: of roughly 30 different apps in various stages of development (several of which Aaron worked on directly), 
                    he knows of only one that ever got deployed. It was through this failure that Aaron learned critical lesson #1 of building technology in the water industry: the end-users must 
                    be given a stake in the development process from the beginning of the project.

                    seen by Data Scientists,  -->

                    <!-- From the identification of
                    non-revenue water, to the development of contamination early-warning systems in source water, to water quality compliance sampling,
                    to real-time flood prediction in stormwater systems, to the analysis of health and safety risks affecting utility workers, 
                    to developing replacement plans for aging utility assets, to the development of IoT pipelines for sensor data using LORAWan, to financial considerations for utility rate cases, to utility data governance, 
                    Aaron has worked with data from virtually every domain across the modern water utility. <br><br> 
                     
                    It is this unique combination of technical ability with industry experience that makes Aaron's skillset truly valuable. 
                    
                    
                    Aaron's first experience in the industry was working for a "startup within a large utility."  

                      
                    depth and breadth of the cultural and organizational chasm that existed
                    between the Operational folks doing the job and the technology teams' failure to build solutions that truly reflected their needs.



                    
                    
                -->

                    <!-- The opportunity to work on such a wide range of projects came from two factors: his love of the Python programming language and his position within the Environmental Leadership team of 
                    the largest water utility in the US. 
                    
                    At American Water, Aaron was a 
                    Data Scientist on a team of industry veterans with decades of experience living and breathing
                    the industry's most critical and persistent problems. This gave Aaron unique insight into a side of technology development rarely
                    seen by Data Scientists, Developers, and even Product Managers. <br><br>

                    Through participation in an $80 million corporate initiative to build "a digital platform for everything water," he witnessed first-hand the difficulty of deploying full-scale digital applications
                    in the water industry. Of roughly 30 different apps in development over the course of 3 years (several of which Aaron worked on directly), he knows of only 1 that ever got deployed.
                    
                     It was only in working on the "Ops side" of the fence that Aaron learned one of the most important lessons of his career -- that the key to digital transformation in the water industry is not technology
                    but a commitment to building long-term relationships that are centered on trust. 
                     <br><br>
                    
                    
                    Based on the belief that successful digital solutions only succeed through long-term relationships centered on trust, 
                    Aaron's first solution is a compliance sampling validation tool built for Water Quality Supervisors. <br><br>
